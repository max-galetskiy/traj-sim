This directory contains the implementation of a combined similarity measure consisting of
    - the continuous Frechet distance
    - the Hausdorff distance
    - DTW distance

Since this combined similarity measure was an experimental idea which I pursued in my thesis,
most of this code will be undocumented. Should there be a poor soul which is actually interested
in this area, then do not be afraid to contact me.

Abandon all hope, ye who enter here.
